Finding links between what characteristics can cause diabetes in women.

The used dataset contains characteristics of women in a Native American tribe in USA and whether they have diabetes or not. After doing some preproscessing of the dataset and scaling the predictor variables I use three different three machine learning algorithms to try and find any correlation between the characteristics and diabetes. These algorithms are namely KNN Regression, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. All of the models had a descent accuracy score.
